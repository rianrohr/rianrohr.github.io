    <section id="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The current student portal has a poorly structured design, creating an overwhelming user experience. Navigation is cluttered, making it difficult for students to access critical tools like class schedules, registration, and financial aid information quickly.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="challenge">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Students need a user-friendly interface that enables them to easily view their schedules, register for courses, and make changes. The redesign must balance simplicity and functionality, ensuring an intuitive experience while retaining access to a wide range of tools.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="current-interface">
        <h2>What it looks like now...</h2>
        <p>The current CampusConnect interface lacks intuitive navigation and a clear hierarchy. Users often report difficulty locating basic resources, which leads to frustration and wasted time.</p>
        <p>Key issues include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Overwhelming navigation menu with no clear categories</li>
                <li>Poor visual hierarchy that buries important features</li>
                <li>Outdated design that doesn’t align with modern usability standards</li>
            </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="research">
        <h2>How can we make the interface less challenging for users?</h2>
        <p>Insert survey research</p>
        <p>Conducted a survey with 50 students, revealing that over 70% found the current interface confusing, with the top complaints being difficulty finding tools and slow navigation speed. Students prioritized quick access to schedules and registration tools.</p>
            <p>Analyzed similar platforms from other universities, such as University of Michigan - Ann Arbor and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, identifying effective navigation patterns, streamlined menu layouts, and modern design elements. These insights informed the design of CampusConnect’s updated interface.</p>
        <p>Insert competitive analysis</p>
    </section>

    <section id="information-architecture">
        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <p>After initial research, I designed a user flow to create a logical and intuitive navigation system. The flow prioritized essential student tasks, such as accessing schedules, registering for courses, and viewing financial aid, while consolidating less-used features into secondary menus.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="interface-development">
        <h2>Interface Development</h2>
        <p>The development process began with low-fidelity sketches to map the layout of the redesigned interface. These sketches were iterated upon based on user feedback, eventually transitioning to medium- and high-fidelity prototypes created in Figma.</p>
        <img src="CC Redesign/redMain.png" alt="Redesigned Landing Page" class="centered">
        <p>The redesigned landing page simplifies navigation by grouping core tools into clear categories, improving accessibility and reducing cognitive load for users.</p>
        <img src="CC Redesign/redNav.png" alt="Redesigned Menu Bar" class="centered">
        <p>The new menu bar features dropdown categories, ensuring students can quickly find the tools they need without navigating through cluttered menus.</p>
        <img src="CC Redesign/redRegister.png" alt="Redesigned Registration UI" class="centered">
        <p>The registration UI was overhauled to present available courses in a clean, easy-to-read format, with filters for departments, availability, and schedules.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection and Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Through this project, I gained valuable insights into user-centered design and the importance of research in guiding solutions. Survey results helped accurately identify pain points, such as overwhelming navigation and poor accessibility, which informed targeted improvements in the redesign.</p>
        <p>By conducting a competitive analysis, I identified design patterns that worked well in similar platforms, avoiding common pitfalls and focusing on usability. These findings translated into a streamlined interface with intuitive navigation, modern visuals, and a logical hierarchy of tools.</p>
        <p>The final high-fidelity prototype demonstrated how students could seamlessly navigate through the redesigned CampusConnect, providing an efficient and user-friendly experience that met their needs.</p>
