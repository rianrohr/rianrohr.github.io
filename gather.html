        <h1>Gather: A Planner Virtual Assistant</h1>
        <h3>Empowering community engagement</h3>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>“Gather: A Planner Virtual Assistant” is a case study exploring a prototype designed to
            enhance event discovery and planning by integrating AI technology and APIs. This
            application personalizes user recommendations, suggests events based on geolocation,
            and helps organize schedules according to the user’s calendar. The high-fidelity
            designs demonstrate the envisioned features and user experience. This case study
            serves as a research example, showcasing how AI technology, such as Eventbrite,
            Google Maps, and Google Calendar APIs, can redefine community engagement.</p>

    <section id="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Finding local, relevant, and up-to-date events that meet specific user needs is often a
            frustrating process.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="challenge">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Many existing platforms lack the extended personalization needed
            to align with users’ specific interests, locations, or schedules, ultimately resulting in
            missed opportunities for community engagement. The challenge was to design an intuitive and efficient interface that balances simplicity and functionality, providing tailored recommendations and easy navigation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="current-interface">
        <h2>Current Interface Comparison</h2>
        <p>Most current event discovery platforms offer generic recommendations and lack robust personalization features. Geolocation is often underutilized, and calendar integrations are limited, leaving users to manage schedules manually. These issues create friction and reduce overall user engagement.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="research">
        <h2>AI and API Research</h2>
        <p>Extensive research was conducted on AI platforms like ChatGPT, Bard, and IBM Watson. ChatGPT was selected for its conversational natural language processing capabilities, which allow for personalized event recommendations and seamless user interaction.</p>
        <p>For APIs, I explored Eventbrite for event listings, Google Maps for geolocation, and Google Calendar for scheduling integration. These tools were chosen for their robust functionality, extensive documentation, and proven reliability in app development.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="information-architecture">
        <h2>Low-fidelity sketches</h2>
        <p>After initial research, I designed low-fidelity sketches to outline the app’s core structure. These sketches focused on intuitive navigation, efficient user flows, and clear access to key features like event search, geolocation, and calendar integration.</p>

    <section id="interface-development">
        <h2>Interface Development</h2>
        <p>The interface development process involved transitioning from low-fidelity sketches to medium- and high-fidelity designs. Each step focused on refining user flows and visual elements based on feedback. Figma was used to develop prototypes, allowing for iterative improvements.</p>
        <img src="Gather/gatherLanding.png" alt="Landing Page" class="centered">
        <p>The landing page introduces users to the app with quick access to personalized recommendations and upcoming events.</p>
        <img src="Gather/gatherEventDetails.png" alt="Event Details Page" class="centered">
        <p>The event details page provides comprehensive information about each event, including location, time, and an option to add the event to the user’s calendar.</p>
        <img src="Gather/gatherProfile.png" alt="Profile" class="centered">
        <p>The profile section allows users to adjust their preferences, view saved events, and manage connected accounts like Google Calendar.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="reflection">
        <h2>Reflection and Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Through this project, I learned the importance of combining user research with technology to create a meaningful and functional design. Survey insights guided the identification of pain points, while competitive analysis informed the design decisions.</p>
        <p>The final high-fidelity prototype demonstrates how users can easily discover and plan events through a seamless interface. Integrating AI and APIs helped build a robust foundation for delivering personalized, real-time recommendations that foster community engagement.</p>
